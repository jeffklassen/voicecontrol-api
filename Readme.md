# Voice Rememberance API
## Introduction
This is an API used to manage requests to create, modify and retrieve to-do lists using voice commands. The application leverages 3rd party voice recognition and natural language processing provider Wit.ai for those features. Once Wit.ai has parsed the voice utterance, the Voice Rememberance API performs actions - ie, elasticsearch look ups - and returns requested data to the client.

This application is intended to be paired with the Android Rememberance Client which is not opensource at this time.

Currently in beta.
